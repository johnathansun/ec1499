# Bernanke-Blanchard, Revisited: An Alternative Model of Pandemic-Era Inflation

This repository contains the code and data used in the Econ 1499 project of Jerry Liang and Johnathan Sun.

The main folder is ``Replication Package/Code and Data`` which contains the materials necessary to replicate the paper section by section. 

For each subfolder, like ``(2) Regressions`` we also include a folder ``Replicate_BB`` which contains a replication of the original code from Bernanke and Blanchard (2023) implemented completely in Python instead of Stata, R, or Matlab.
